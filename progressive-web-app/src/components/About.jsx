            We focused on building an app that delivers fast performance, accessibility, and a seamless user experience. Hereâ€™s how:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Service Workers:</strong> Leveraged to cache assets and provide offline functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web App Manifest:</strong> Allows users to install the app and interact with it as if it's a native application.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lazy Loading & Code Splitting:</strong> Enhances performance by loading components only when they are needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Implemented WCAG standards, ensuring the app is usable by people with disabilities.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </motion.div>
      </section>

      <section className="about-goal">
        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <motion.p
          initial={{ y: 100 }}

          Our mission was to create a PWA that feels intuitive and fast, yet functions offline with a native app feel. The blend of modern technologies like React, Service Workers, and Framer Motion allowed us to enhance user experience, improve performance, and provide a scalable foundation for future development.
